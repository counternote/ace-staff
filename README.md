# ACE Staff
The simplest (and dumbest) improvement on traditional staff notation.

The ACE staff came about from an observation while transcribing the grand staff to Counternote.  By removing the top line of the bass clef and the bottom line of the treble clef, the spaces in the new four-line staff spell ACE from low to high and the ledger lines between them also spell ACE from low to high. Like I said, dumbest.

However, this little change makes it so that both staffs are identical with regard to note placement — the only difference is the octave. And since the treble and bass clefs include ACE in their spaces — FACE for treble, ACEG for bass — there is very little unlearning necessary to be able to read the ACE staff.

## New Clefs

Because the treble and bass clef work out of the box, no new clefs for the octaves above and below middle C are necessary. But because of the symmetry of the staffs, there is room for a new C-clef without the baggage of the current movable C-clef for the center clef and a B-clef for a sub-bass clef and a D-clef for a super-treble clef.

## Why Does It Work?

There are seven diatonic tones in western music (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si) and two placements on the staff, a line or a space. Since two does not evenly divide seven, a tone that starts on a line will cycle around to a space and then beck to a line on the second pass two octaves above. Every seventh line is the same tone. One a four-line staff, that leaves three ledger lines left before it returns to the oringinal tone: G, B, D, F on the staff lines and A, C, E on the ledgers for a 4:3 staff-to-ledger lines ratio.

## But Why Not Five-lines?

This can be done and even communicated easily as the FACE staff with the in-between ledger lines AC for a 5:2 ratio. Ok. Maybe this is the simplest in a vacuum. But it’s not more elegant for the simple reason that middle-C is never in the middle of either the staff or the ledgers. Could we center C using the alto clef? Sure. And convince the 99% of musicians who do not play viola to adopt it contrary to years of habituation? That is decidedly less simple or feasible.

## But More Ledger Lines?

It is true that a four-line staff, all else being equal, will require the use of ledger lines before a five-line staff. This is a valid criticism. However, “I hate ledger lines” isn’t a criticism, it’s a preference — a perfectly valid one. A real criticism, one that some have raised, is the accessibility issues regarding ledger lines, issues shared with the status quo, just a little more so. After four ledger lines above or below, they do get much harder to read, but with the ACE staff and its new clefs, the composer can change the clef up or down an octave to keep the notes closer to the staff. And given the symmetry of the ledger lines above and below the staff, after a bit of familiarity, I personally find it easier to remember the positions because there is no more mental arithmetic for each different clef.

## But Four-Part Harmonies?

This criticism is a criticism, but not a valid one. I have a hard time even understanding it. There is literally nothing about four-part harmonies that one less staff line changes. If you think this criticism is valid — by all means, show me examples. But as far as I can tell, this is nothing more than trolling.

## Four Lines — Why Not Just Return to Neumes?

Five lines? Why not just return to Mensural Notation?
